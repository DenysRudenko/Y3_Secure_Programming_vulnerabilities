# Y3_Secure_Programming_vulnerabilities

Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
This guide assumes you will use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

## Project Installation Guide

Create a Virtual Environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Once activated, youâ€™ll see (venv) in your terminal prompt, indicating that you are inside the virtual environment. To deactivate, simply type:

```bash
deactivate
```
